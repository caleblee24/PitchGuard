# PitchGuard - Product One Pager

## Problem Statement

**MLB teams lose $1.5B annually to pitcher injuries**, with the average pitcher missing 60+ days per season. Current injury prevention relies on subjective assessments and reactive monitoring, leading to:

- **Late detection**: Injuries often discovered after damage is done
- **Inconsistent monitoring**: No standardized workload tracking across teams
- **Limited predictive power**: Traditional metrics don't capture cumulative fatigue patterns
- **Poor decision support**: Coaches lack actionable insights for workload management

## Solution Overview

PitchGuard is an AI-powered pitcher workload monitoring system that predicts injury risk using historical pitch data and workload patterns.

### Core Value Proposition

**Predict injury risk 21 days in advance** using interpretable machine learning on pitch-level data, enabling proactive workload management.

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Risk Assessment**
   - Daily injury risk scores (0-100%) for all active pitchers
   - 21-day forward-looking prediction window
   - Calibrated probability outputs with confidence intervals

2. **Workload Intelligence**
   - Rolling pitch count analysis (3-game, 7-day, 14-day windows)
   - Velocity and spin rate trend monitoring
   - Recovery pattern analysis and rest day optimization

3. **Actionable Insights**
   - "Why now" explanations for elevated risk
   - Specific mitigation recommendations
   - Comparative analysis vs. league averages

4. **Team Dashboard**
   - Overview of all pitchers with risk indicators
   - Trend visualization and alert system
   - Historical risk pattern analysis

## Target Users

**Primary**: MLB pitching coaches, training staff, and front office personnel
**Secondary**: Sports medicine teams and player development staff

## Competitive Advantages

- **Data-driven**: Uses actual pitch-level data vs. subjective assessments
- **Interpretable**: Explains risk factors in plain language
- **Proactive**: 21-day prediction window vs. reactive monitoring
- **Actionable**: Provides specific workload management recommendations

## Success Metrics
