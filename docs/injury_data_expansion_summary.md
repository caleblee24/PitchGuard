## 🔍 **DATA ANALYSIS RESULTS**

### **Collected Injury Data (217 records)**
- **Source Distribution**: ESPN (212), FantasyPros (5)
- **Severity Distribution**: Moderate (13), Unknown (5), Mild (2)
- **Data Quality**: All records have confidence scores and source attribution

### **Current Limitations**
- **Injury Parsing**: Most injuries classified as "unknown" type/location
- **Pitcher Identification**: Need better mapping to existing pitcher database
- **Data Completeness**: Limited historical depth (mostly current injuries)
