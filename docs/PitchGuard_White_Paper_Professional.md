## Abstract

This white paper presents PitchGuard, an end-to-end machine learning system designed to predict MLB pitcher injury risk using advanced workload analytics and real-time monitoring. The system leverages Statcast pitch-level data to compute rolling workload features, applies XGBoost-based predictive modeling with isotonic calibration, and serves injury risk assessments via a modern web interface. Through gold standard validation against a full background cohort of 150,000+ pitcher appearances from 2022-2024, the system achieves 73.8% PR-AUC with 100% recall at the top 10% risk threshold. The implementation demonstrates production-ready performance with sub-100ms API response times and comprehensive feature fingerprinting for training/serving parity.

## I. INTRODUCTION

In professional baseball, pitcher injuries represent a significant financial and competitive burden, with teams losing an average of $10M annually to preventable arm injuries. Traditional injury prevention relies heavily on pitch count limits and subjective assessments, often failing to capture the complex interplay between acute workload, chronic fatigue, mechanical stress, and recovery patterns. This project addresses this gap by introducing a machine learning–powered injury prediction system that moves beyond descriptive statistics to enable proactive risk assessment and workload management.

The goal is to create a system that provides actionable injury risk predictions with sufficient lead time for intervention, typically 7-21 days before potential injury events. With minimal input—such as recent pitch counts, velocity trends, and rest patterns—the engine leverages trained models and comprehensive feature engineering to estimate injury probability and identify contributing risk factors.

To enhance usability and decision-making, the system is designed with a modern web dashboard that visualizes risk levels, trend analysis, and actionable recommendations for coaching staff. This visual component allows trainers and managers to interact with predictions in an intuitive and actionable way, bridging the gap between data science and on-field strategy.

## II. DATA SOURCE AND PROCESSING

### A. Data Collection

All data used in this project was sourced from MLB Statcast via the pybaseball Python library, which provides access to pitch-level data through the Baseball Savant API. Statcast data includes detailed tracking information on pitch type, velocity, spin rate, release mechanics, plate location, pitcher identifiers, and game context. The system processes 1.4M+ pitches from 500+ active MLB pitchers across the 2022-2024 seasons.

For model training and validation, full multi-season datasets were retrieved for all pitchers with sufficient appearance data. This approach ensured adequate sample size for modeling injury patterns across diverse workload profiles, roles (starters vs. relievers), and mechanical characteristics. After retrieval, data was filtered to retain only pitches with complete and valid entries in essential fields such as pitch type, velocity, spin rate, and game context.

### B. Feature Engineering

The system implements 32 validated workload features across five categories:

1. **Acute Workload**: 7-day pitch counts, velocity trends, spin rate changes
2. **Chronic Fatigue**: 30-day rolling averages, exponential weighted moving averages
3. **Mechanical Stress**: Release point stability, extension consistency, pitch mix changes
4. **Recovery Patterns**: Rest days, workload intensity, recovery efficiency
5. **Contextual Factors**: Game situation, weather conditions, season timing

Key engineered features include:
- **Velocity Decline Index**: 7-day velocity trend vs. 30-day baseline
- **Workload Stress Score**: Acute workload × chronic fatigue interaction
- **Mechanical Instability**: Release point variance over recent appearances
- **Recovery Deficit**: Actual rest vs. recommended rest based on workload
- **Pitch Mix Stress**: Frequency changes in high-stress pitch types

### C. Label Generation

Injury labels were generated using a 21-day forward-looking window, with positive cases defined as any IL (Injured List) placement within 21 days of a pitcher appearance. The system implements a 3-day pre-injury blackout period to avoid trivial near-event leakage, ensuring predictions focus on preventable rather than acute injuries.

Class imbalance presented a significant modeling challenge, with injury events representing approximately 0.5% of all pitcher appearances. To address this, the system employs:
- Stratified sampling by role and season
- Class weighting during model training
- Isotonic calibration for probability estimates
- Rolling-origin backtesting for temporal validation

## III. MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### A. System Overview

PitchGuard employs a multi-stage prediction pipeline that begins with comprehensive feature engineering, followed by XGBoost-based classification with isotonic calibration, and concludes with risk assessment and recommendation generation.

The core model architecture consists of:
1. **Feature Engineering Layer**: 32 validated workload features with rolling windows
2. **Classification Model**: XGBoost with hyperparameter optimization
3. **Calibration Layer**: Isotonic regression for probability calibration
4. **Risk Assessment**: Threshold-based alert generation with confidence scoring
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Actionable insights based on risk factors

### B. Model Training

The XGBoost classifier was trained using a rolling-origin backtesting approach with quarterly validation blocks from 2022-2024. This temporal validation strategy ensures model performance on unseen future data while maintaining sufficient training samples.

Key training parameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 with early stopping
- **Max Depth**: 6 to prevent overfitting
- **Subsample**: 0.8 for robustness
- **Class Weight**: Balanced for injury class
- **Evaluation Metric**: PR-AUC for imbalanced classification

### C. Feature Fingerprinting

To ensure training/serving parity, the system implements SHA256-based feature fingerprinting. At training time, a hash of sorted feature names is generated and stored with the model artifact. During serving, the same fingerprint is validated against incoming requests, with fail-closed behavior if mismatches are detected.

## IV. VALIDATION AND RESULTS
