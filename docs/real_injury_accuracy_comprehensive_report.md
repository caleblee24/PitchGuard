## 🔍 ACCURACY ASSESSMENT BREAKDOWN

### **Strengths**

1. **High Precision (100%)**: When the model flags a pitcher as high-risk, it's almost certainly correct
2. **Conservative Threshold**: Using top 30% threshold ensures quality over quantity
3. **Feature Consistency**: Core workload features show strong predictive signals
4. **Injury Type Differentiation**: Model distinguishes between injury types effectively
5. **Real Data Foundation**: Built on 1.4M+ actual MLB pitches

### **Limitations**

1. **Moderate Recall (35.7%)**: Misses some injuries due to conservative approach
2. **Synthetic Labels**: Original training used appearance gaps, not medical injury data
3. **Limited Sample**: 115 validation cases (small for comprehensive assessment)
4. **Feature Mismatch**: Enhanced features not perfectly aligned with real injury patterns
5. **Temporal Validation**: Limited backtesting on historical injury sequences
