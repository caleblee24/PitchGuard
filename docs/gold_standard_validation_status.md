# üéØ Gold Standard Validation Sprint - Status Update

**Date: August 21, 2025**  
**Sprint Day: 1**  
**Status: ON TRACK** ‚úÖ

---

## üöÄ **COMPLETED TODAY (Day 1)**

### **‚úÖ 1. Snapshot Policy Definition**
- **File**: `docs/snapshot_policy.md`
- **Key Decisions**:
  - **Snapshot Unit**: Per-appearance (pitcher on game_date)
  - **Risk Horizon**: 21-day window for injury prediction
  - **Blackout Period**: 3-day exclusion to prevent near-event leakage
  - **Injury Types**: Arm-related only (elbow, shoulder, forearm, lat, rotator_cuff, UCL)
- **Impact**: Fixes selection bias by defining proper evaluation universe

### **‚úÖ 2. Feature Contract & Specification**
- **File**: `backend/etl/features_spec.md`
- **Key Components**:
  - **32 Features**: Complete specification with formulas, types, units
  - **Coverage Requirements**: 80%+ for core features, 70%+ for velocity
  - **Missing Data Handling**: Median imputation + missing flags
  - **Version Control**: Tracked feature evolution
- **Impact**: Single source of truth for feature engineering

### **‚úÖ 3. Feature Fingerprint System**
- **File**: `backend/utils/feature_fingerprint.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - **SHA256 Hashing**: Unique fingerprint for feature sets
  - **Training Storage**: Saved with model artifacts
  - **Serving Validation**: Fail-closed if fingerprints don't match
  - **Standard Features**: 32-feature v2.0 contract
- **Impact**: Guarantees training/serving parity

## üìä **VALIDATION APPROACH TRANSFORMATION**

### **Before (Current State)**
```
‚ùå Selection Bias: Only evaluated against injury cases
‚ùå Feature Mismatch: Training/serving inconsistencies
‚ùå Undefensible Results: 100% precision on injury-only cohort
‚ùå No Thresholds: Arbitrary risk levels
```

### **After (Target State)**
```
‚úÖ Full Background Cohort: All appearances evaluated
‚úÖ Feature Fingerprint: Guaranteed training/serving parity
‚úÖ Defensible Results: Proper PR-AUC vs full population
‚úÖ Actionable Thresholds: 5%, 10%, 20% alert budgets
```

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Day 2)**

### **Priority 1: Full Background Cohort**
- [ ] **Build Complete Dataset**
  - Load all appearances 2022-2024 (150K+ snapshots)
  - Apply snapshot policy and labeling
  - Validate positive rates (target: 2% overall)
  - Generate injury labels with blackout exclusions

### **Priority 2: API Integration**
- [ ] **Add Fingerprint Validation**
  - Integrate fingerprint check in risk assessment API
  - Add fingerprint logging for each request
  - Test fail-closed behavior
  - Update model loading process

### **Priority 3: Initial Validation**
- [ ] **First Backtest Run**
  - Create rolling-origin blocks (quarterly)
  - Run first validation block
  - Calculate baseline metrics
  - Document initial results

---

## üìà **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **Technical Metrics (Targets)**
- **PR-AUC**: >0.70 (vs full background cohort)
- **Recall@Top-10%**: >0.40
- **Feature Fingerprint**: 100% training/serving parity
- **Positive Rate**: 2% (realistic injury rate)

### **Operational Metrics (Targets)**
- **Alert Budget**: 10% threshold with >0.15 precision
- **Lead Time**: Median >7 days for high-risk alerts
- **Alerts/Day**: <50 alerts per day across league
- **Hit Rate**: >15% true positives per 100 alerts

---

## üîç **KEY INSIGHTS FROM TODAY**

### **1. Selection Bias Correction**
- **Problem**: Our "100% precision" was meaningless because we only evaluated injury cases
- **Solution**: Full background cohort with 2% positive rate
- **Impact**: Results will be defensible to MLB recruiters

### **2. Feature Contract Importance**
- **Problem**: Feature mismatches causing model failures
- **Solution**: SHA256 fingerprint system with fail-closed validation
- **Impact**: Production-ready reliability

### **3. Operational Thresholds**
- **Problem**: Arbitrary risk levels not actionable for coaches
- **Solution**: Alert budgets (5%, 10%, 20%) with precision/recall tradeoffs
- **Impact**: Coaches can plan around predictable alert volumes

## üö® **RISKS & MITIGATION**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Data Processing Delays**: Parallel processing for large datasets
- **Feature Mismatch**: Fingerprint system prevents this
- **Model Performance**: Rolling-origin validation prevents overfitting

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Complex Implementation**: Modular approach with clear deliverables
- **Integration Issues**: Comprehensive testing at each step
- **Documentation Gaps**: Template-driven documentation

---

## üìã **DAY 2 DELIVERABLES**

### **Must Complete**
- [ ] Full background cohort dataset (150K+ snapshots)
- [ ] Updated API with fingerprint validation
- [ ] Initial backtest results
- [ ] Positive rate validation by season/role

### **Nice to Have**
- [ ] First calibration attempt
- [ ] Alert budget calculations
- [ ] Performance baseline documentation

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR DAY 2**

### **Technical Success**
- [ ] Feature fingerprint system fully integrated
- [ ] Full background cohort processed
- [ ] First backtest block completed
- [ ] API serving with fingerprint validation

### **Quality Success**
- [ ] Positive rates match expected 2% baseline
- [ ] No feature mismatches in serving
- [ ] Backtest metrics calculated correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **Business Success**
- [ ] Results defensible to technical audience
- [ ] Clear path to recruiter pack
- [ ] Operational thresholds defined
- [ ] Deployment readiness improved

---

## üöÄ **LOOKING AHEAD**

### **Day 3-4**: Gold validation cohort and rolling backtests
### **Day 5-6**: Calibration and alert budgets
### **Day 7**: Recruiter pack and deployment readiness

**The foundation is solid. We're on track to deliver a production-ready, defensibly validated system by the end of the sprint.**
